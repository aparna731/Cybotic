        <p class="font1">Our visit to Christa Sevakee Ashram in Parpale, Karkala, a missionary institute of the Church of South India, was a heartwarming experience. The Ashram, which had two Homes for the aged men and women, had been founded in the year 1950. Its noble mission encompassed caring for orphans, the abandoned, the destitute, and contributing to the welfare of society, with no discrimination based on caste, color, or creed. In addition to its role as a haven for the elderly, it served as a center for retreats, conferences, and a short stay facility for distressed women.<br>

            Our interaction with the elderly residents was a significant aspect of our visit. It allowed us, as students, to cultivate empathy and gain a deeper understanding of the challenges that accompany aging. This firsthand encounter fostered greater respect and sensitivity towards older individuals, motivating us to engage more actively with our local community and support its members. It also instilled in us a sense of responsibility and social awareness. Conversing with the elderly enabled us to refine our communication and interpersonal skills, as we learned to adapt our communication styles to bridge the generational gap.</p>
        <p class="font1">Spending quality time with older adults played a pivotal role in shaping our attitudes toward aging in a more positive light. Through these interactions, we came to appreciate the wisdom and contributions of elderly individuals to society.<br>

            Our arrival at the Ashram occurred around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, guided by Reverend Berty, the Ashram's manager. The gathering took place in a spacious hall, with the elderly residents seated at the front and the students positioned at the back. Reverend Berty commenced the gathering with a prayer of praise, followed by introductions of the residents and students. Following the introductions, our host, Pritesh, spoke to the residents about our purpose for spending time with them.</p>
        <p class="font1">To foster a deeper connection with the residents, we encouraged them to share their life stories and valuable experiences. Some graciously volunteered, offering insightful advice on leading a fulfilling life. Recognizing that old age does not diminish the inner spirit of youth, we organized a "pass the ball" game. When the whistle blew, the possessor of the ball claimed victory and received a small gift. Subsequently, we engaged in a singing game, where it became evident that the elderly excelled even more than the student participants.

            After a medley of songs, we decided to conclude the games and engage in more intimate conversations with the elderly residents. We distributed the fruits and snacks we had brought with us as a token of our appreciation and care.<br>
            
            Though our desire was to spend more time with the residents, our schedule was constrained. Pritesh, our host, expressed gratitude to the elderly residents, Reverend Berty, and requested their blessings. Several students, including Shourya and Shreya, came forward to share their thoughts on how profoundly the visit had impacted them. Reverend Berty then delivered a closing speech, extending gratitude to Mite College and all involved, concluding the gathering with heartfelt praise and blessings to the Lord, beseeching blessings for the students in their future endeavors in life.</p>
