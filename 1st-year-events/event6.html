        <p class="font1">Debugging was the process of detecting and removing existing and potential errors (commonly referred to as 'bugs') in a software code, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. In our department, the choice of the C programming language for the debugging competition had been made. The competition had consisted of two rounds:<br>

            In the first round, participants had faced a set of Multiple-Choice Questions, encompassing 20 questions, each carrying a point. They had been tasked with completing all the questions within a strict 20-minute timeframe. This segment of the event had been conducted using Google Forms. Out of a total of 21 teams that had entered, only 7 teams had successfully qualified for the subsequent round.</p>
        <p class="font1">The second round, known as the final debugging round, had presented participants with a series of five intricate problems. These problems included challenges such as Recursive Exponentiation, Sorting (Bubble-Sort), First occurrence in a sorted array, Pattern printing, and String reversing, all of which had contained both syntax and logical errors. Teams had been awarded 20 points for each problem they had successfully debugged. This segment had been hosted on HackerRank and featured a strict time limit of one hour for teams to resolve all five problems.<br>

            After the hour had elapsed, the winners and runners-up had been determined based on the evaluation of participation results. The victorious team had comprised Thrishik Shetty and Makaranda Gore, who had aptly named their team "Error." Meanwhile, the second-place team had been Skanda and Srinivas, who had chosen the moniker "Syntax Slayers." Dr. Shivananda V Seri, the head of our department, had announced and celebrated the achievements of these teams, distributing cash prizes as recognition of their prowess. Furthermore, feedback had been collected from the students via Google Forms to gauge their experience and suggestions for improvement. All participants had been awarded participation e-certificates to commemorate their involvement in the competition.</p>
        <p class="font1">In the spirit of fostering camaraderie and enhancing the learning experience, the debugging competition had also featured a collaborative element. During the final debugging round, teams were allowed to consult with each other and share insights on resolving the challenging coding issues. This collaborative aspect encouraged knowledge exchange and problem-solving discussions among participants, contributing to a dynamic and engaging atmosphere throughout the event.<br>

            In the aftermath of the competition, a post-event analysis and feedback session had been conducted. Participants had the opportunity to reflect on their experiences and provide constructive feedback on the competition's format, difficulty level, and overall organization. This feedback proved invaluable in fine-tuning future iterations of the competition, ensuring that it continued to serve as a platform for students to hone their debugging skills and compete at the highest level.</p>
