            Dr. Shivananda V. Seeri, the Head of CSE (IoT & Cybersecurity with Blockchain Technology), warmly welcomed our guests.</p>
        <p class="font1">Mr. Manoj T addressed the gathering, posing questions such as "What is IoT and CyberSecurity?" and "Dapps Development for Cybersecurity."
<br>
The speaker proceeded to elaborate on IoT, defining it as a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people equipped with unique identifiers (UIDs) capable of transferring data over a network without necessitating human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. He also delved into the distinction between IoT and IoT devices, exploring the core meaning of cybersecurity and its benefits, as well as how it's developed with the assistance of blockchain technology.<br>

During his talk, Mr. Manoj T specifically covered topics such as the shift from centralized to decentralized systems, the fundamentals of blockchain and smart contracts, dispelling myths about blockchain, discussing generations of blockchain technology, layered architecture for blockchain, types of blockchains, and the relevance of blockchain in the context of cybersecurity, particularly within the realm of IoT. He also highlighted popular frameworks, tools, and programming languages for blockchain development and guided students on where to find learning resources to enhance their understanding of IoT and cybersecurity.

</p>
        <p class="font1">In conclusion, Mr. Manoj T emphasized the significance of understanding IoT, its design, and management, along with providing a brief overview of cybersecurity. To ensure clarity, a quick Q&A session was held at the end of the session, addressing any doubts and queries. This informative session was attended by approximately 66 second-year students specializing in CSE IoT & Cybersecurity with Blockchain Technology, enriching their knowledge in the fields of blockchain and Dapps Development for Cybersecurity.
