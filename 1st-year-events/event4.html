        <p class="font1">"Call of Duty" was an immensely popular online multiplayer game played worldwide by a vast
            community of gamers. Published by Activision, a renowned video game publisher, this iconic game was
            originally launched in 2003 by Activision in collaboration with the developer, Infinity Ward.<br>

            The COD Mobile Tournament, organized by the CSE-IOT department, had been a meticulously executed event
            characterized by thorough planning and efficient organization. Teams had been required to complete
            registrations through Google Forms, ensuring a streamlined and convenient registration process.
            Additionally, a dedicated WhatsApp group had been established to facilitate seamless communication between
            participating teams and the event management, enabling quick updates and effective coordination. Fixture
            details for the matches had been released two days prior to the tournament, allowing teams ample time to
            strategize and prepare. The tournament brochure had contained all essential information, including venue
            details, timing, and rules, ensuring participants had clear guidelines to follow.</p>
        <p class="font1">On the day of the tournament, teams had been instructed to gather half an hour before the
            scheduled start time at a designated venue. Here, their attendance had been recorded, and the rules had been
            reiterated to ensure fair and smooth gameplay. The matches had been conducted according to the predetermined
            fixtures, with seats arranged in advance to accommodate participants and spectators comfortably. The
            management had efficiently assigned organizers to oversee different matches, ensuring a well-coordinated and
            seamless execution of the event. The tournament had followed a knockout format, infusing excitement and
            competitiveness into every match. The finals had taken place in the presence of IOT faculty, adding prestige
            and significance to the event. The following day, the winners had received trophies and prize money, a
            well-deserved recognition of their accomplishments and a source of motivation for future tournaments.
            <br>
            Overall, the COD Mobile Tournament organized by CSE-IOT had been a resounding success, attributable to the
            meticulous planning, effective communication, and efficient execution carried out by the dedicated
            management team. The event had not only provided a platform for competitive gaming but also fostered a sense
            of community among passionate gamers.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">In addition to the competitive gaming experience, the COD Mobile Tournament had also promoted
            camaraderie and sportsmanship among participants. Throughout the event, there had been an atmosphere of
            mutual respect and friendly rivalry, where players showcased their gaming skills while fostering new
            friendships and connections. Spectators and participants had engaged in enthusiastic conversations about
            strategies, game tactics, and their shared passion for gaming. The tournament had not only served as a
            platform for showcasing gaming prowess but had also reinforced the sense of belonging to a larger gaming
            community within the CSE-IOT department. This sense of unity and shared enthusiasm had undoubtedly left a
            lasting impact on all those who had participated in or witnessed the event, making it a memorable and
            enriching experience for everyone involved.
            <br>
            Moreover, the tournament had embraced technological advancements by live-streaming matches on popular gaming
            platforms, reaching a global audience of gaming enthusiasts. The inclusion of commentary and analysis had
            added an extra layer of excitement, enhancing the viewing experience for those unable to attend in person.
            This innovative approach had not only made the tournament accessible to a wider audience but had also
            elevated its status in the gaming community.
