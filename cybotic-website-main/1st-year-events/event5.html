        <p class="font1">The event was held at auditorium 3 in the main block and had been organized and conducted by the CYBOTIC club of the CSE (IOT WITH CYBER SECURITY AND BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY) Department. The event had commenced at 2.00 PM with an address by the Master of Ceremony. Following the formal address, a demonstration and explanation of the rules and guidelines were provided to the participants.<br>

            The participants for the event had been pre-registered, and students had been called to the stage in accordance with their registration order. Topics for each round had been assigned to teams just 10 minutes before the start of their respective rounds. Teams were formed in pairs, resulting in a total of 6 rounds before the final one. Each round had accommodated 6 teams, with a fixed duration of 12 minutes. Within this time frame, each team had been allotted 2 minutes to present their opinions, with a time alert given 10 seconds before the end of their allotted time. This well-structured schedule had allowed all rounds to be completed within the designated event timings.</p>
        <p class="font1">Throughout the competition, winning teams had emerged from each of the individual rounds, while there had been 3 rounds that ended in ties. The tiebreaker rounds, along with the grand final, had taken place on 27 June 2023, this time in Auditorium 2 within the main block. The winners of the tied rounds had progressed to the final, where the topic of discussion had been "Apple vs Android." The final round had included a total of 4 teams, and it had proceeded smoothly. At the conclusion of the final round, the judge had delivered their decision.<br>

            Dr. Shivananda V Seeri, the Head of the Department, had announced the results. The runner-ups of the competition had been Jnanesh and Nagaprasanna, while the top honors had gone to Hemanth and Suchan. The event had not only been a platform for healthy competition but had also served as a valuable lesson for participants, highlighting the importance of skills such as public speaking, effective communication, and team coordination. Overall, the event had been a resounding success, leaving participants with valuable experiences and insights.</p>
        <p class="font1">As the event unfolded, it became evident that the participants were not only showcasing their debating prowess but also displaying their ability to think critically and articulate their opinions persuasively. The topics assigned to each round were carefully chosen to challenge the participants' knowledge, analytical thinking, and rhetorical skills. The lively debates and spirited discussions in each round demonstrated the depth of talent and enthusiasm among the students.<br>

            In addition to the competitive aspect, the event had a significant educational component. Participants had the opportunity to receive constructive feedback from judges after each round, helping them understand their strengths and areas for improvement. This feedback mechanism aimed to foster personal growth and development in the domains of public speaking, communication, and teamwork.</p>
